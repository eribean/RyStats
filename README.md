# RyStats

A collection of statistical packages writtten in python.

## Factor Analysis

Several factor analysis routines are implemented including:

1. Principal Components Analysis
2. Principal Axis Factoring
3. Maximum Likelihood
4. Minimum Rank

### Rotation

1. Orthogonal / Oblique
2. Procrustes

### Dimensionality Assessment

 1. Parallel Analysis
 2. MAP (Minimum Average Partial)

### Miscellaneous

1. Polychoric Correlations

# Plotting Tools

Plotting Tools require Bokeh and are made to be used within a Jupyter Notebook

### Plot Functions

1. correlation_image: creates a heatmap of a correlation matrix
2. loading_image: creates a heatmap of a loadings matrix
3. scree_plot: plots the eigenvalues for dimensionality assessment
4. loading_table: creates a table that displays the loadings matrix

# Dependencies

1. Numpy
2. Scipy
3. Bokeh (for plotting)

# Installation

Via pip

```csh
pip install RyStats --upgrade
```

From Source

```csh
pip install . -t $PYTHONPATH --upgrade
```

## Unittests

**Pytest** with coverage

```csh
pytest --cov=RyStats --cov-report term
```
